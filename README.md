# Perinatal Outcome Prediction 

## Background

- Early detection of fetal abnormalities from Fetal Heart Rate and uterine contraction using cardiotocography technique has become vital in ensuring the well-being of both the fetus and the expecting mother.
- Continuous Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) assessment is essential for fetal status identification, particularly premature labor, and placental abruption diagnosis.
- A longitudinal cohort study showed that birth defects increased the mortality risk from circulatory, respiratory, and digestive causes by 23 times, compared to those without birth defects.

## Dataset Information

The aim of this study is to develop and compare four classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost classifier, to predict fetal status. The algorithms' performance was compared to when the hyperparameter tuning technique was applied to the classification models.
